The GdR 3645 *Ecologie Statistique* is funded by the CNRS INEE. It proposes actions to favor exchanges between french scientists interested in the development and application of statistical methods to answer questions of ecology and evolutionary biology. It facilitates knowledge transfer and exchanges between evolutionary biologists, ecologists and statisticians in order to improve the analysis and processing of biological data.

The main objectives of the GDR EcoStat are to

(i) evaluate existing statistical methods,

ii) to explore the application of recent methods often unknown to ecologists and evolutionary biologists,

iii) develop new statistical approaches and

iv) to ensure knowledge transfer to potential users of these methods.
