I am research scientist at the [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) based in [Université Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) ([Biometry and Evolutionary Biology Lab, UMR 5558](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/)).

I am a statistical ecologist (aka biometrician, biostatistician, quantitative ecologist, numerical ecologist, etc.). My work consists in developing novel statistical methods for analyzing biological data with a special emphasis on multivariate analysis and spatial statistics. I am mainly interested in understanding the role of multiple factors (e.g., species traits, environment) that influence the (spatial) structure of ecological communities and control beta diversity.

I am contributor/author of several software (freeware, open source) including the ade4 package for R which provides statistical and graphical tools for the analysis of multivariate data.
