abstract: This paper reports the output of a consensus symposium organized by the
  International Union of Radioecology in November 2015. The symposium gathered an
  academically diverse group of 30 scientists to consider the still debated ecological
  impact of radiation on populations and ecosystems. Stimulated by the Chernobyl and
  Fukushima disasters' accidental contamination of the environment, there is increasing
  interest in developing environmental radiation protection frameworks. Scientific
  research conducted in a variety of laboratory and field settings has improved our
  knowledge of the effects of ionizing radiation on the environment. However, the
  results from such studies sometimes appear contradictory and there is disagreement
  about the implications for risk assessment. The Symposium discussions therefore
  focused on issues that might lead to different interpretations of the results, such
  as laboratory versus field approaches, organism versus population and ecosystemic
  inference strategies, dose estimation approaches and their significance under chronic
  exposure conditions. The participating scientists, from across the spectrum of disciplines
  and research areas, extending also beyond the traditional radioecology community,
  successfully developed a constructive spirit directed at understanding discrepancies.
  From the discussions, the group has derived seven consensus statements related to
  environmental protection against radiation, which are supplemented with some recommendations.
  Each of these statements is contextualized and discussed in view of contributing
  to the orientation and integration of future research, the results of which should
  yield better consensus on the ecological impact of radiation and consolidate suitable
  approaches for efficient radiological protection of the environment.
