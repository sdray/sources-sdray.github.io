abstract: The processes that give rise to species richness gradients are not well
  understood, but may be linked to resource-based limits on the number of species
  a region can support. Ecological limits placed on regional species richness should
  also affect population demography, suggesting that these processes could also generate
  genetic diversity gradients. If true, we might better understand how broad-scale
  biodiversity patterns are formed by identifying the common causes of genetic diversity
  and species richness. We develop a hypothetical framework based on the consequences
  of regional variation in ecological limits set by resource availability and heterogeneity
  to simultaneously explain spatial patterns of species richness and neutral genetic
  diversity. Repurposing raw genotypic data spanning 38 mammal species sampled across
  801 sites in North America, we show that estimates of genome-wide genetic diversity
  and species richness share spatial structure. Notably, species richness hotspots
  tend to harbor lower levels of within-species genetic variation. A structural equation
  model encompassing eco-evolutionary processes related to resource availability,
  habitat heterogeneity, and contemporary human disturbance supports the spatial patterns
  we detect. These results suggest broad-scale patterns of species richness and genetic
  diversity could both partly be caused by intraspecific demographic and evolutionary
  processes acting simultaneously across species.
