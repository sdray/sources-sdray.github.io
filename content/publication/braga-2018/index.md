abstract: The fourth-corner analysis aims to quantify and test for relationships between
  species traits and site-specific environmental variables, mediated by site-specific
  species abundances. Since there is no common unit of observation, the significance
  of the relationships is tested using a double permutation procedure (site based
  and species based). This method implies that all species and sites are independent
  of each other. However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic
  relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data.
  Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial
  and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type
  I error rates, suggesting that signifi- cant associations can be misidentified.
  As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this
  issue, based on Moran’s spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations
  are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic
  under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic
  and spatial structures of the observed data. The inclusion of this new randomization
  approach provides total control over type I error rates and should be used in real
  studies where spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations often occur.
