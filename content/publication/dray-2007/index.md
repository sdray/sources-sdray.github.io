abstract: Multivariate analyses are well known and widely used to identify and understand
  structures of ecological communities. The ade4 package for the R statistical environment
  proposes a great number of multivariate methods. Its implementation follows the
  tradition of the French school of \"Analyse des Données\" and is based on the use
  of the duality diagram. We present the theory of the duality diagram and discuss
  its implementation in ade4. Classes and main functions are presented. An example
  is given to illustrate the ade4 philosophy.
