abstract: The fourth-corner problem entails estimation and statistical testing of
  the relationship between species traits and environmental variables from the analysis
  of three data tables. In a 2008 paper, S. Dray and P. Legendre proposed and evaluated
  five permutation methods for statistical significance testing, including a new two-step
  testing procedure. However, none of these attained the correct type I error in all
  cases of interest. We solve this problem by showing that a small modification of
  their two-step procedure controls the type I error in all cases. The modification
  consists of adjusting the significance level from sqrt(alpha) to alpha or, equivalently,
  of reporting the maximum of the individual P values as the final one. The test is
  also applicable to the three-table ordination method RLQ.
