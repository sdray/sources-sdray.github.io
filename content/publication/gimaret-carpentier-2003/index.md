abstract: 'A crucial step in understanding the origin and maintenance of biological
  diversity is the assessment of its distribution over space and time and across environmental
  gradients. At the regional scale, two important attributes of species can be assessed
  that provide insight into speciation processes: species geographical and environmental
  ranges. The endemic tree flora of the Western Ghats is an interesting case for analyzing
  broad-scale biodiversity patterns because of the steep environmental gradients that
  characterize this tropical region of India. We analysed species geographical and
  environmental ranges by Canonical Correlation Analysis of point data from herbarium
  collections. We performed partial analyses to discriminate spatial and environmental
  correlates of species distribution, and evaluate the contribution of higher taxonomic
  ranks to these ranges. We identified different levels of organization in the distribution
  of endemism: 1) general features, such as the concentration of endemic species in
  the southern part of the Western Ghats, and the decrease in endemic species richness
  along the altitudinal and the dry season length gradients, and 2) patterns specific
  to genera or families, such as species niche separation along the environmental
  gradients. Our analyses enabled us to formulate hypotheses about the diversification
  of the endemic tree flora of the Western Ghats. They also confirm the value of Canonical
  Correlation Analysis as the suitable method for collection data analysis.'
