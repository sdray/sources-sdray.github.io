abstract: Studies of animal movements have been popularized for many large and shy
  species by the increasing use of radio telemetry methods (VHF and GPS technologies).
  Data are collected with high sampling frequency, and consist of successive observations
  of the position of an individual animal. The statistical analysis of such data poses
  several problems due to the lack of independence of successive observations. However,
  the statistical description of the temporal autocorrelation between successive steps
  is rarely performed by ecologists studying the patterns of animals movements. The
  aim of this paper is to warn ecologists against the consequences of failing to consider
  this aspect. We discuss the various issues related to analyzing autocorrelated data,
  and show how the exploratory analysis of autocorrelation can both reveal important
  biological insights and help to improve the accuracy of movement models. We suggest
  some tools that can be used to measure, test, and adjust for temporal autocorrelation.
  A short ecological illustration is presented.
