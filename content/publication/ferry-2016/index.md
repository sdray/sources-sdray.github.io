abstract: Animals may anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters
  with other competitors. This may ultimately impact their foraging distribution and
  intake rates. Such cryptic interference competition is difficult to measure in the
  field, and extremely little is known at the interspecific level. We tested the hypothesis
  that smaller species avoid larger ones because of potential costs of interference
  competition and hence expected them to segregate from larger competitors at the
  scale of a resource patch. We assessed fine-scale spatial segregation patterns between
  three African herbivore species (zebra Equus quagga, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros
  and giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) and a megaherbivore, the African elephant Loxodonta
  africana, at the scale of water resource patches in the semi-arid ecosystem of Hwange
  National Park, Zimbabwe. Nine waterholes were monitored every two weeks during the
  dry season of a drought year, and observational scans of the spatial distribution
  of all herbivores were performed every 15 min. We developed a methodological approach
  to analyse such fine-scale spatial data. Elephants increasingly used waterholes
  as the dry season progressed, as did the probability of co-occurrence and agonistic
  interaction with elephants for the three study species. All three species segregated
  from elephants at the beginning of the dry season, suggesting a spatial avoidance
  of elephants and the existence of costs of being close to them. However, contrarily
  to our expectations, herbivores did not segregate from elephants the rest of the
  dry season but tended to increasingly aggregate with elephants as the dry season
  progressed. We discuss these surprising results and the existence of a trade-off
  between avoidance of interspecific interference competition and other potential
  factors such as access to quality water, which may have relative associated costs
  that change with the time of the year.
