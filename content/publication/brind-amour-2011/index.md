abstract: Understanding the relationships between species biological traits and the
  environment is crucial to predicting the effect of habitat perturbations on fish
  communities. It is also an essential step in the assessment of the functional diversity.
  Using two complementary three-matrix approaches (fourth-corner and RLQ analyses),
  we tested the hypothesis that feeding-oriented traits determine the spatial distributions
  of littoral fish species by assessing the relationship between fish spatial distributions,
  fish species traits, and habitat characteristics in two Laurentian Shield lakes.
  Significant associations between the feeding-oriented traits and the environmental
  characteristics suggested that fish communities in small lakes (displaying low species
  richness) can be spatially structured. Three groups of traits, mainly categorized
  by the species spatial and temporal feeding activity, were identified. The water
  column may be divided in two sections, each of them corresponding to a group of
  traits related to the vertical distribution of the prey coupled with the position
  of the mouth. Lake areas of low structural complexity were inhabited by functional
  assemblages dominated by surface feeders while structurally more complex areas were
  occupied by mid-water and benthic feeders. A third group referring to the time of
  feeding activity was observed. Our work could serve as a guideline study to evaluate
  species traits × environment associations at multiple spatial scales. Our results
  indicate that three-matrix statistical approaches are powerful tools that can be
  used to study such relationships. These recent statistical approaches open up new
  research directions such as the study of spatially based biological functions in
  lakes. They also provide new analytical tools for determining, for example, the
  potential size of freshwater protected areas.
