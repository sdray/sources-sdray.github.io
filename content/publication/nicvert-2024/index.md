abstract: Interspecific interactions can influence species' activity and movement
  patterns. In particular, species may avoid or attract each other through reactive
  responses in space and/or time. However, data and methods to study such reactive
  interactions have remained scarce and were generally limited to two interacting
  species. At this time, the deployment of camera traps opens new opportunities but
  adapted statistical techniques are still required to analyze interaction patterns
  with such data. We present the multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) and show how it
  can be used to analyze interactions between several species using camera trap data.
  Hawkes processes use flexible pairwise interaction functions, allowing us to consider
  asymmetries and variations over time when depicting reactive temporal interactions.
  After describing the theoretical foundations of the MHP, we outline how its framework
  can be used to study interspecific interactions with camera trap data. We design
  a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the MHP and of another existing
  method to infer interactions from camera trap-like data. We also use the MHP to
  infer reactive interactions from real camera trap data for five species from South
  African savannas (impala Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros,
  lion Panthera leo, blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Burchell's zebra Equus
  quagga burchelli). The simulation study shows that the MHP can be used as a tool
  to benchmark other methods of interspecific interaction inference and that this
  model can reliably infer interactions when enough data are considered. The analysis
  of real data highlights evidence of predator avoidance by prey and herbivore–herbivore
  attraction. Lastly, we present the advantages and limits of the MHP and discuss
  how it can be improved to infer attraction/avoidance patterns more reliably. As
  camera traps are increasingly used, the multivariate Hawkes process provides a promising
  framework to decipher the complexity of interactions structuring ecological communities.
