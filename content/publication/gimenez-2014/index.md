abstract: 'The desire to predict the consequences of global environmental change has
  been the driver towards more realistic models embracing the variability and uncertainties
  inherent in ecology. Statistical ecology has gelled over the past decade as a discipline
  that moves away from describing patterns towards modelling the ecological processes
  that generate these patterns. Following the fourth International Statistical Ecology
  Conference (1-4 July 2014) in Montpellier, France, we analyse current trends in
  statistical ecology. Important advances in the analysis of individual movement,
  and in the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, are made
  possible by the increasing use of hierarchical and hidden process models. Exciting
  research perspectives include the development of methods to interpret citizen science
  data and of efficient, flexible computational algorithms for model fitting. Statistical
  ecology has come of age: it now provides a general and mathematically rigorous framework
  linking ecological theory and empirical data.'
