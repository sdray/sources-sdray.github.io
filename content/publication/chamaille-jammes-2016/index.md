abstract: The spatial structuring of populations or communities is an important driver
  of their functioning and their influence on ecosystems. Identifying the (in)stability
  of the spatial structure of populations is a first step towards understanding the
  underlying causes of these structures. Here we studied the relative importance of
  spatial vs. interannual variability in explaining the patterns of abundance of a
  large herbivore community (8 species) at waterholes in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe).
  We analyzed census data collected over 13 years using multivariate methods. Our
  results showed that variability in the census data was mostly explained by the spatial
  structure of the community, as some waterholes had consistently greater herbivore
  abundance than others. Some temporal variability probably linked to Park-scale migration
  dependent on annual rainfall was noticeable, however. Once this was accounted for,
  little temporal variability remained to be explained, suggesting that other factors
  affecting herbivore abundance over time had a negligible effect at the scale of
  the study. The extent of spatial and temporal variability in census data was also
  measured for each species. This study could help in projecting the consequences
  of surface water management, and more generally presents a methodological framework
  to simultaneously address the relative importance of spatial vs. temporal effects
  in driving the distribution of organisms across landscapes.
