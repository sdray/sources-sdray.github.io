abstract: Many perennial plants display masting, that is, fruiting with strong interannual
  variations, irregular and synchronized between trees within the population. Here,
  we tested the hypothesis that the early flower phenology in temperate oak species
  promotes stochasticity into their fruiting dynamics, which could play a major role
  in tree reproductive success. From a large field monitoring network, we compared
  the pollen phenology between temperate and Mediterranean oak species. Then, focusing
  on temperate oak species, we explored the influence of the weather around the time
  of budburst and flowering on seed production, and simulated with a mechanistic model
  the consequences that an evolutionary shifting of flower phenology would have on
  fruiting dynamics. Temperate oak species release pollen earlier in the season than
  do Mediterranean oak species. Such early flowering in temperate oak species results
  in pollen often being released during unfavorable weather conditions and frequently
  results in reproductive failure. If pollen release were delayed as a result of natural
  selection, fruiting dynamics would exhibit much reduced stochastic variation. We
  propose that early flower phenology might be adaptive by making mast-seeding years
  rare and unpredictable, which would greatly help in controlling the dynamics of
  seed consumers.
