abstract: Movement is fundamental to individual and population dynamics, as it allows
  individuals to meet their basic requirements. Although movement patterns reflect
  interactions between internal and external factors, only few studies have examined
  the effects of these factors on movement simultaneously, and they generally focused
  on particular biological contexts (e.g. dispersal, foraging). However, the relative
  importance of these factors in driving individual routine movements might reflect
  a species' potential flexibility to cope with landscape changes and therefore buffer
  their potential impact on fitness. We used data from GPS collars on Scandinavian
  brown bears to investigate the relative role of these factors, as well as an additional
  factor (period of the year) on routine movements at two spatial scales (hourly and
  daily relocations). As expected, internal factors played a major role in driving
  movement, compared to external factors at both scales, but its relative importance
  was greater at a finer scale. In particular, the interaction between reproductive
  status and period of the year was one of the most influential variables, females
  being constrained by the movement capacity of their cubs in the first periods of
  the year. The effect of human disturbance on movement was also greater for females
  with cubs than for lone females. This study showed how reciprocal modulation of
  internal and external factors is shaping space use of brown bears. We stress that
  these factors should be studied simultaneously to avoid the risk of obtaining context-dependent
  inferences. Moreover, the study of their relative contribution is also highly relevant
  in the context of multiple-use landscapes, as human activities generally affect
  the landscape more than they affect the internal states of an individual. Species
  or individuals with important internal constraints should be less responsive to
  changes in their environment as they have less freedom from internal constraints
  and should thus be more sensitive to human alteration of the landscape, as shown
  for females with cubs in this study.
