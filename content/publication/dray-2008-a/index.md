abstract: 'Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species
  traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes
  in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls
  for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence-absence
  values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the
  environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological
  or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method
  was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental
  variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely
  used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original
  method and program to presence-absence data in L and to the analysis of a single
  trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often
  have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed.
  In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the
  original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species
  traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by
  abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then,
  using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures.
  A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will
  help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological
  problem.'
