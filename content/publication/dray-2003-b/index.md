abstract: Classical multivariate analyses are based on matrix algebra and enable the
  analysis of a table containing measurements of a set of variables for a set of sites.
  Incomplete mapped data consist of measurements of a set of variables recorded for
  the same geographical region but for different zonal systems and with only a partial
  sampling of this zone. This kind of data cannot be analysed with usual multivariate
  methods because there is no common system of sites for all variables. We propose
  a new approach using GIS technology and NIPALS, an iterative multivariate method,
  to analyse the spatial patterns of this kind of data. Moreover, an extension of
  our method is that it can be used for areal interpolation purposes. We illustrate
  the method in analysing data concerning the distribution of roe deer weights over
  several years in a reserve.
