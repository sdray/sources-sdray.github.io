abstract: 'Question: Which functional diversity indices have the power to reveal changes
  in community assembly processes along abiotic stress gradients? Is their power affected
  by stochastic processes and variations in species richness along stress gradients?
  Methods: We used a simple community assembly model to explore the power of functional
  diversity indices across a wide range of ecological contexts. The model assumes
  that with declining stress the influence of niche complementarity on species fitness
  increases while that of environmental filtering decreases. We separately incorporated
  two trait-independent stochastic processes – mass and priority effects – in simulating
  species occurrences and abundances along a hypothetical stress gradient. We ran
  simulations where species richness was constant along the gradient, or increased,
  decreased or varied randomly with declining stress. We compared observed values
  for two indices of functional richness – total functional dendrogram length (FD)
  and convex hull volume (FRic) – with a matrix-swap null model (yielding indices
  SESFD and SESFRic) to remove any trivial effects of species richness. We also compared
  two indices that measure both functional richness and functional divergence – Rao
  quadratic entropy (Rao) and functional dispersion (FDis) – with a null model that
  randomizes abundances across species but within communities. This converts them
  to pure measures of functional divergence (SESRao and SESFDis). Results:When mass
  effects operated, only SESRao and SESFDis gave reasonable power, irrespective of
  how species richness varied along the stress gradient. FD, FRic, Rao and FDis had
  low power when species richness was constant, and variation in species richness
  greatly influenced their power. SESFRic and SESFD were unaffected by variation in
  species richness. When priority effects operated, FRic, SESFRic, Rao and FDis had
  good power and were unaffected by variation in species richness. Variation in species
  richness greatly affected FD and SESFD. SESRao and SESFDis had low power in the
  priority effects model but were unaffected by variation in species richness. Conclusions:
  Our results demonstrate that a reliable test for changes in assembly processes along
  stress gradients requires functional diversity indices measuring either functional
  richness or functional divergence. We recommend using SESFRic as a measure of functional
  richness and either SESRao or SESFDis (which are very closely related mathematically)
  as a measure of functional divergence. Used together, these indices of functional
  richness and functional divergence provide good power to test for increasing niche
  complementarity with declining stress across a broad range of ecological contexts.'
