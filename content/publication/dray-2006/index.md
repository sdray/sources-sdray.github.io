abstract: Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the
  dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based
  processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships
  must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach
  called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create
  spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical
  analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family
  of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in
  ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the
  PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure
  functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix,
  then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation.
  These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression
  or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method,
  and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that
  will better suit their needs.
