abstract: Fisher's principle states that natural selection favours an equal number
  of male and female births at the population level, unless there are sex differences
  in rearing costs or sex differences in mortality before the end of the period of
  parental investment. Sex differences in rearing costs should be more pronounced
  in low- than in high-resource settings. We, therefore, examined whether human development
  index and sex differences in child mortality contribute to the natural variation
  in human sex ratio at birth across the globe. As predicted by Fisher's principle,
  the proportion of male births increased with both increasing male-biased childhood
  mortality and level of development of each country. However, these relationships
  were absent after accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, which
  our inference is conditioned on. This work shows how the failure to account for
  residual spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding support
  for predictions from sex allocation theory.
