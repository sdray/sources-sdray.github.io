abstract: 'The Loricariinae belong to the Neotropical mailed catfish family Loricariidae,
  the most species-rich catfish family. Among loricariids, members of the Loricariinae
  are united by a long and flattened caudal peduncle and the absence of an adipose
  fin. Despite numerous studies of the Loricariidae, there is no comprehensive phylogeny
  of this morphologically highly diversified subfamily. To fill this gap, we present
  a molecular phylogeny of this group, including 350 representatives, based on the
  analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genes (8426 positions). The resulting phylogeny
  indicates that Loricariinae are distributed into two sister tribes: Harttiini and
  Loricariini. The Harttiini tribe, as classically defined, constitutes a paraphyletic
  assemblage and is here restricted to the three genera Harttia, Cteniloricaria, and
  Harttiella. Two subtribes are distinguished within Loricariini: Farlowellina and
  Loricariina. Within Farlowellina, the nominal genus formed a paraphyletic group,
  as did Sturisoma and Sturisomatichthys. Within Loricariina, Loricaria, Crossoloricaria,
  and Apistoloricaria are also paraphyletic. To solve these issues, and given the
  lack of clear morphological diagnostic features, we propose here to synonymize several
  genera (Quiritixys with Harttia; East Andean members of Crossoloricaria, and Apistoloricaria
  with Rhadinoloricaria; Ixinandria, Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella with
  Rineloricaria), to restrict others (Crossoloricaria, and Sturisomatichthys to the
  West Andean members, and Sturisoma to the East Andean species), and to revalidate
  the genus Proloricaria.'
