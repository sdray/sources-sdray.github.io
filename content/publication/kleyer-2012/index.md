abstract: 'Question: How do multivariate methods perform in relating species- and
  community-level trait responses to the environment? Location (1) Field data from
  grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods: Research
  questions associated with trait-environment relationships were briefly reviewed
  and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions
  is whether trait-environment relationships should be addressed at community or species
  level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted
  by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The
  other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays
  (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations
  of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment.
  A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM)
  predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients.
  RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then
  uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species
  responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic
  regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental
  variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental
  gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results: All methods
  consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data
  set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing
  intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA
  gave a good overview of trait-environment relationships, as also provided by the
  species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships
  in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability
  of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more
  strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions: Each method addresses particular
  ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average
  trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the
  first choice. However, species-based methods should be applied to address questions
  regarding co-existence of different life histories or to assess how groups of species
  respond to environmental changes. The artificial data set revealed that the methods
  differed in sensitivity to gradient lengths and random data.'
