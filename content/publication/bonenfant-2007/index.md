abstract: The study of sexual segregation has received increasing attention over the
  last two decades. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence
  of sexual segregation, such as the \"predation risk hypothesis\", the \"forage selection
  hypothesis\", and the \"activity budget hypothesis\". Testing which hypothesis drives
  sexual segregation is hampered, however, by the lack of consensus regarding a formal
  measurement of sexual segregation. By using a derivation of the well-known chi-square
  (here called the sexual segregation and aggregation statistic [SSAS]) instead of
  existent segregation coefficients, we offer a reliable way to test for temporal
  variation in the occurrence of sexual segregation and aggregation, even in cases
  where a large proportion of animals are observed alone. A randomization procedure
  provides a test for the null hypothesis of independence of the distributions of
  males and females among the groups. The usefulness of SSAS in the study of sexual
  segregation is demonstrated with three case studies on ungulate populations belonging
  to species with contrasting life histories and annual grouping patterns (isard,
  red deer, and roe deer). The existent segregation coefficients were unreliable since,
  for a given value, sexual segregation could or could not occur. Similarly, the existent
  segregation coefficients performed badly when males and females aggregated. The
  new SSAS was not prone to such limitations and allowed clear conclusions regarding
  whether males and females segregate, aggregate, or simply mix at random applicable
  to all species.
