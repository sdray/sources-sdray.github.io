abstract: The gut contents of a guild of invertebrate grazers inhabiting the moss
  Fontinalis and feeding on epiphytic diatoms in a small Que´ bec stream were analyzed
  to characterize resource partitioning and food selection. A multivariate approach
  (RLQ analysis coupled with a revised version of 4th-corner analysis) identified
  distinct diet patterns among co-occurring grazers. These patterns were mainly explained
  by differential ingestion of diatoms that differed in their spatial positions within
  the multilayered periphyton mat. When the size range of available diatoms was large,
  diet differences were partly explained by diatom size. Comparison of diatoms in
  grazer guts with diatoms available in the environment indicated selective feeding
  in different levels of the periphyton mat by grazers. Some grazers (scrapers) fed
  preferentially on tightly attached diatoms, whereas others (surfers) favored overstory
  diatoms. Spatial segregation of feeding within the periphyton mat by members of
  the grazer guild was more evident in a period of potential resource limitation (July)
  than when food was abundant (May). Our results suggest that all layers/growth forms
  in the diatom mat are used, resulting in spatial partitioning of the resource when
  considering the entire grazer community. Therefore, foraging theories already established
  for other ecosystems are confirmed in the unique context of stream benthos.
