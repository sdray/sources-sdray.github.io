abstract: Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral
  traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions.
  Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable,
  and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring
  factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help
  infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies
  would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community
  composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of
  site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods
  of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit
  ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale
  analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial
  characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize
  here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting
  matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or
  scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree
  communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant
  residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured
  explanatory variables or processes.
