abstract: "The identification of spatial structures is a key step in understanding\
  \ the ecological processes structuring the distribution of organisms. Spatial patterns\
  \ in species distributions result from a combination of several processes occuring\
  \ at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a crucial issue. Recent\
  \ studies have proposed a new family of spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates\
  \ of neighbours matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for modelling\
  \ of spatial variation on different scales. To assess the multi-scale spatial patterns\
  \ in multivariate data, these variables are often used as predictors in constrained\
  \ ordination methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial predictors\
  \ is still troublesome, and the identification of the main scales of spatial variation\
  \ remains an open question. This paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle\
  \ this issue: the multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses\
  \ MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial scales and then\
  \ summarizes this decomposition using graphical representations. A canonical form\
  \ of MSPA can also be used to assess the spatial scales of the species-environment\
  \ relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using simulated data,\
  \ and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites dataset. The method is implemented\
  \ in the free software R."
