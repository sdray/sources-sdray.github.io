abstract: 'Assessing trait responses to environmental gradients requires the simultaneous
  analysis of the information contained in three tables: L (species distribution across
  samples), R (environmental characteristics of samples), and Q (species traits).
  Among the available methods, the so-called fourth-corner and RLQ methods are two
  appealing alternatives that provide a direct way to test and estimate trait–environment
  relationships. Both methods are based on the analysis of the fourth-corner matrix,
  which crosses traits and environmental variables weighted by species abundances.
  However, they differ greatly in their outputs: RLQ is a multivariate technique that
  provides ordination scores to summarize the joint structure among the three tables,
  whereas the fourth-corner method mainly tests for individual trait–environment relationships
  (i.e., one trait and one environmental variable at a time). Here, we illustrate
  how the complementarity between these two methods can be exploited to promote new
  ecological knowledge and to improve the study of trait–environment relationships.
  After a short description of each method, we apply them to real ecological data
  to present their different outputs and provide hints about the gain resulting from
  their combined use.'
