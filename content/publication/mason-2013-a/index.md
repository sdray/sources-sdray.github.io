abstract: An understanding of the processes governing natural afforestation over large
  spatial scales is vital for enhancing forest carbon sequestration. Models of tree
  species occurrence probability in non-forest vegetation could potentially identify
  the primary variables determining natural afforestation. However, inferring processes
  governing afforestation using tree species occurrence is potentially problematic,
  since it is impossible to know whether observed occurrences are due to recruitment
  or persistence of existing trees following disturbance. Plant functional traits
  have the potential to reveal the processes by which key environmental and land cover
  variables influence afforestation. We used 10,061 survey plots to identify the primary
  environmental and land cover variables influencing tree occurrence probability in
  non-forest vegetation in New Zealand. We also examined how these variables influenced
  diversity of functional traits linked to plant ecological strategy and dispersal
  ability. Mean annual temperature was the most important environmental predictor
  of tree occurrence. Local woody cover and distance to forest were the most important
  land cover variables. Relationships between these variables and ecological strategy
  traits revealed a trade-off between ability to compete for light and colonize sites
  that were marginal for tree occurrence. Biotically dispersed species occurred less
  frequently with declining temperature and local woody cover, suggesting that abiotic
  stress limited their establishment and that biotic dispersal did not increase ability
  to colonize non-woody vegetation. Functional diversity for ecological strategy traits
  declined with declining temperature and woody cover and increasing distance to forest.
  Functional diversity for dispersal traits showed the opposite trend. This suggests
  that low temperatures and woody cover and high distance to forest may limit tree
  species establishment through filtering on ecological strategy traits, but not on
  dispersal traits. This study shows that 'snapshot' survey plot data, combined with
  functional trait data, may reveal the processes driving tree species establishment
  in non-forest vegetation over large spatial scales.
