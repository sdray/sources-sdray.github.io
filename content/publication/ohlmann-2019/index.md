abstract: Describing how ecological interactions change over space and time and how
  they are shaped by environmental conditions is crucial to understand and predict
  ecosystem trajectories. However, it requires having an appropriate framework to
  measure network diversity locally, regionally and between samples ($α$-, $γ$- and
  $β$-diversity). Here, we propose a unifying framework that builds on Hill numbers
  and accounts both for the probabilistic nature of biotic interactions and the abundances
  of species or groups. We emphasise the importance of analysing network diversity
  across different species aggregation levels (e.g. from species to trophic groups)
  to get a better understanding of network structure. We illustrate our framework
  with a simulation experiment and an empirical analysis using a global food-web database.
  We discuss further usages of the framework and show how it responds to recent calls
  on comparing ecological networks and analysing their variation across environmental
  gradients and time.
