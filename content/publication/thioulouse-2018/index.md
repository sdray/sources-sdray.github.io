abstract: This book introduces the ade4 package for R which provides multivariate
  methods for the analysis of ecological data. It is implemented around the mathematical
  concept of the duality diagram, and provides a unified framework for multivariate
  analysis. The authors offer a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework
  of the duality diagram and also of its application to real-world ecological problems.
  These two goals may seem contradictory, as they concern two separate groups of scientists,
  namely statisticians and ecologists. However, statistical ecology has become a scientific
  discipline of its own, and the good use of multivariate data analysis methods by
  ecologists implies a fair knowledge of the mathematical properties of these methods.
  The organization of the book is based on ecological questions, but these questions
  correspond to particular classes of data analysis methods. The first chapters present
  both usual and multiway data analysis methods. Further chapters are dedicated for
  example to the analysis of spatial data, of phylogenetic structures, and of biodiversity
  patterns. One chapter deals with multivariate data analysis graphs. In each chapter,
  the basic mathematical definitions of the methods and the outputs of the R functions
  available in ade4 are detailed in two different boxes. The text of the book itself
  can be read independently from these boxes. Thus the book offers the opportunity
  to find information about the ecological situation from which a question raises
  alongside the mathematical properties of methods that can be applied to answer this
  question, as well as the details of software outputs. Each example and all the graphs
  in this book come with executable R code.
