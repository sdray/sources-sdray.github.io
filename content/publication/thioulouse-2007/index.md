abstract: ade4 is a multivariate data analysis package for the R statistical environment,
  and ade4TkGUI is a Tcl/Tk graphical user interface for the most essential methods
  of ade4. Both packages are available on CRAN. An overview of ade4TkGUI is presented,
  and the pros and cons of this approach are discussed. We conclude that command line
  interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI) are complementary. ade4TkGUI
  can be valuable for biologists and particularly for ecologists who are often occasional
  users of R. It can spare them having to acquire an in-depth knowledge of R, and
  it can help first time users in a first approach.
