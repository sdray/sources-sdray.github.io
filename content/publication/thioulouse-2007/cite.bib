 abstract = {ade4 is a multivariate data analysis package for the R statistical environment, and ade4TkGUI is a Tcl/Tk graphical user interface for the most essential methods of ade4. Both packages are available on CRAN. An overview of ade4TkGUI is presented, and the pros and cons of this approach are discussed. We conclude that command line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI) are complementary. ade4TkGUI can be valuable for biologists and particularly for ecologists who are often occasional users of R. It can spare them having to acquire an in-depth knowledge of R, and it can help first time users in a first approach.},
