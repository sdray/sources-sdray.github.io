abstract: In large mammal communities, little is known about modification of interspecific
  interactions through habitat structure changes. We assessed the effects of African
  elephants (Loxodonta africana) on features of woody habitat structure that can affect
  predator–prey interactions. We then explored how this can influence where African
  lions (Panthera leo) kill their prey. Indeed, lions are stalk-and-ambush predators
  and habitat structure and concealment opportunities are assumed to influence their
  hunting success. During 2 years, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, kill sites (n,=,167)
  of GPS-collared lions were characterized (visibility distance for large mammals,
  distance to a potential ambush site and presence of elephant impacts). We compared
  characteristics of lion kill sites with characteristics of random sites (1) at a
  large scale (i.e. in areas intensively used by lions, n,=,418) and (2) at the microhabitat
  scale (i.e. in the direct surrounding available habitat,,$<$,150 m, n,=,167). Elephant-impacted
  sites had a slightly higher visibility and a longer distance to a potential ambush
  site than non-impacted sites, but these relationships were characterized by a high
  variability. At large scale, kill sites were characterized by higher levels of elephant
  impacts compared to random sites. At microhabitat scale, compared to the direct
  nearby available habitat, kill sites were characterized by a reduced distance to
  a potential ambush site. We suggest a conceptual framework whereby the relative
  importance of habitat features and prey abundance could change upon the scale considered.
