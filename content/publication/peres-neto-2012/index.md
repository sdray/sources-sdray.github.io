abstract: Patterns in biodiversity and species coexistence are the result of multiple
  interacting processes including evolutionary history, trait variation, species interactions,
  dispersal, environmental variation, and landscape heterogeneity. Exploring patterns
  of biodiversity across space is perhaps the best integrative method (in contrast
  to the scarcity of temporal data) to interpret the influence of these multiple and
  interactive effects in determining community assembly, but it is still underdeveloped.
  Two emerging fields, metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics, have been
  making relevant, though rather independent, progress toward understanding how communities
  are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First, we described a heuristical
  framework to merge these two fields into \"metacommunity phylogenetics.\" The main
  goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of
  species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the
  process of community assembly. Second, we developed an analytical framework to link
  niche properties based on trait and phylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation.
  In order to assess the performance of the framework, we used extensive computer
  simulations of community assembly to show that the procedure is robust under a variety
  of scenarios.
