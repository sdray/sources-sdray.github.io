abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard technique to summarize
  the main structures of a data table containing the measurements of several quantitative
  variables for a number of individuals. Here, we study the case where some of the
  data values are missing and propose a review of methods which accommodate PCA to
  missing data. In plant ecology, this statistical challenge relates to the current
  effort to compile global plant functional trait databases producing matrices with
  a large amount of missing values. We present several techniques to consider or estimate
  (impute) missing values in PCA and compare them using theoretical considerations.
  We carried out a simulation study to evaluate the relative merits of the different
  approaches in various situations (correlation structure, number of variables and
  individuals, and percentage of missing values) and also applied them on a real data
  set. Lastly, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches, the potential
  pitfalls and future challenges that need to be addressed in the future.
