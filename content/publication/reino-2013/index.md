abstract: 'Aim: Although the negative effects of habitat fragmentation have been widely
  documented at the landscape scale, much less is known about its impacts on species
  distributions at the biogeographical scale. We hypothesize that fragmentation influences
  the large-scale distribution of area- and edge-sensitive species by limiting their
  occurrence in regions with fragmented habitats, despite otherwise favourable environmental
  conditions. We test this hypothesis by assessing the interplay of climate and landscape
  factors influencing the distribution of the calandra lark, a grassland specialist
  that is highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Location: Iberia Peninsula, Europe.
  Methods: Ecological niche modelling was used to investigate the relative influence
  of climate/topography, landscape fragmentation and spatial structure on calandra
  lark distribution. Modelling assumed explicitly a hierarchically structured effect
  among explanatory variables, with climate/topography operating at broader spatial
  scales than landscape variables. An eigenvector-based spatial filtering approach
  was used to cancel bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation. The information theoretic
  approach was used in model selection, and variation partitioning was used to isolate
  the unique and shared effects of sets of explanatory variables. Results: Climate
  and topography were the most influential variables shaping the distribution of calandra
  lark, but incorporating landscape metrics contributed significantly to model improvement.
  The probability of calandra lark occurrence increased with total habitat area and
  declined with the number of patches and edge density. Variation partitioning showed
  a strong overlap between variation explained by climate/topography and landscape
  variables. After accounting for spatial structure in species distribution, the explanatory
  power of environmental variables remained largely unchanged. Main conclusions: We
  have shown here that landscape fragmentation can influence species distributions
  at the biogeographical scale. Incorporating fragmentation metrics into large-scale
  ecological niche models may contribute for a better understanding of mechanism driving
  species distributions and for improving predictive modelling of range shifts associated
  with land use and climate changes.'
