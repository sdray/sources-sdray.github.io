abstract: 'Spatial relationships between tree species and hydrological soil constraints
  are analysed within a 10-ha rainforest plot at Piste de St Elie in French Guiana.
  We used canonical correlation analysis to cross directly the occurrence-by- species
  table of 4 992 individuals (d.b.h. $>$ 10 cm) belonging to 120 species with qualitative
  soil variables and quantitative spatial data. Firstly, the list of species occurrences
  was confronted to nine soil descriptors characterising a weathering sequence from
  the initial well-drained ferralitic cover to transformed hydromorphic soil conditions.
  This analysis revealed that, apart from some specialised species restricted to the
  swamps that experience prolonged water saturation, the most abundant species can
  be ordered along two intermingled gradients of tolerance limiting their niche amplitude:
  a main gradient of tolerance to prolonged water saturation that appears down slope
  during the weathering sequence; a second gradient of less importance, displaying
  the species intolerant of prolonged water saturation according to their tolerance
  to temporary confinement of the uphill transformed soil systems due to the late
  appearance of a perched water-table. The results support the hypothesis that at
  Piste de St Elie, the constraining soil conditions imposed by surface water saturation
  are more important determinants for tree zonation of many tree species than water
  shortage. Secondly, the list of species occurrences was confronted to a spatial
  data table built from a trend surface regression of the tree coordinates. This analysis
  indicated that soil drainage is the main structuring factor of the local multispecies
  spatial pattern. After partialling out the soil effect, the multispecies pattern
  revealed a broader scale of heterogeneity that we supposed to be linked to endogenous
  factors resulting from population dynamics. Implications of the results are then
  discussed in the perspective of future research on tree zonation, local diversity
  pattern and community structuring in tropical rainforests.'
