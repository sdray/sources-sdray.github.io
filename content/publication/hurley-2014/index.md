abstract: Large herbivore populations respond strongly to remotely sensed measures
  of primary productivity. Whereas most studies in seasonal environments have focused
  on the effects of spring plant phenology on juvenile survival, recent studies demonstrated
  that autumn nutrition also plays a crucial role. We tested for both direct and indirect
  (through body mass) effects of spring and autumn phenology on winter survival of
  2315 mule deer fawns across a wide range of environmental conditions in Idaho, USA.
  We first performed a functional analysis that identified spring and autumn as the
  key periods for structuring the among-population and among-year variation of primary
  production (approximated from 1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Normalized
  Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) along the growing season. A path analysis showed
  that early winter precipitation and direct and indirect effects of spring and autumn
  NDVI functional components accounted for 45% of observed variation in overwinter
  survival. The effect size of autumn phenology on body mass was about twice that
  of spring phenology, while direct effects of phenology on survival were similar
  between spring and autumn. We demonstrate that the effects of plant phenology vary
  across ecosystems, and that in semi-arid systems, autumn may be more important than
  spring for overwinter survival.
