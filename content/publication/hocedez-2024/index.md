abstract: Questions High species richness is observed in certain shrublands on infertile
  substrates. Mineral nutrients are likely to be the primary limiting resources in
  these ecosystems, and below-ground plant interactions may be crucial to understanding
  their diversity. Using ionomics, we investigated whether there were nutritional
  variations between plant species that coexist in a shrubland located in an edaphically
  extreme environment. Location New Caledonia. Methods We set up a 20 m × 20 m plot
  in a diverse shrubland (“maquis”) on ultramafic (infertile) substrate, in which
  we sampled all 475 plants taller than 1 m and characterized their ionome (22 elements).
  Results In our study, 37 species were identified in the plot, representing all major
  forms of mycorrhizal symbioses, as well as nitrogen-fixing plants, cluster rooted
  and parasitic plants. Notably, both nickel hyperaccumulating and manganese hyperaccumulating
  species were present. Hypervolume approaches were used to assess ionome overlap
  among the nine most abundant species, with the results revealing limited overlap.
  Moreover, it was observed that the rarest species in the plot also had the most
  functionally distinct features. Conclusions Different nutritional strategies were
  present in the plot, as demonstrated by the variety of root symbioses and leaf ionomes.
  Our findings indicate coexistence of multiple species within this infertile shrubland
  may be achieved by species partitioning into different highly specialized biogeochemical
  niches.
