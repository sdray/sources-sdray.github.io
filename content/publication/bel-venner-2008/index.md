abstract: 'Sexual selection theory traditionally considers choosiness for mates to
  be negatively related to intra-sexual competition. Males were classically considered
  to be the competing, but not the choosy, sex. However, evidence of male choosiness
  is now accumulating. Male choosiness is expected to increase with an individual’s
  competitive ability, and to decrease as intra-sexual competition increases. However,
  such predictions have never been tested in field conditions. Here, we explore male
  mate choice in a spider by studying size-assortative pairing in two natural sites
  that strongly differ in the level of male–male competition. Unexpectedly, our results
  demonstrate that mate choice shifts from opportunism to high selectivity as competition
  between males increases. Males experiencing weak competition did not exhibit size-related
  mating preferences. By contrast, when competition was intense we found strong size-assortative
  pairing due to male choice: while larger, more competitive males preferentially
  paired with larger, more fecund females, smaller males chose smaller females. Thus,
  we show that mating preferences of males vary with their competitive ability. The
  distinct preferences exhibited by males of different sizes seem to be an adaptive
  response to the lower reproductive opportunities arising from increased competition
  between males.'
