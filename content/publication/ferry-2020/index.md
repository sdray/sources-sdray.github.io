abstract: In many semi-arid savanna ecosystems, surface water is scarce and only found
  in artificially pumped waterholes at the end of the dry season, leading to high
  large mammal densities and competition. Further, the modification of the physico-chemical
  characteristics of the drinking water over the dry season (e.g. through faeces accumulation)
  could enhance competition. Indeed, elephants, considered as key-competitors, and
  other herbivores by aggregating near the trough where clear water arrives could
  compete for this resource. We studied the drinking locations of eight herbivore
  species around pumped waterholes in relation to these water characteristics in Hwange
  National Park, Zimbabwe. We identified differences of the physico-chemical characteristics
  of the water in different sections of pumped waterholes at the end of the dry season.
  Elephants drank the water in or close to the trough, whereas other species drank
  further in the waterhole, except roan and sable antelopes which were indifferent
  about where they drank. Interference competition with elephants for the access to
  water close to the trough was not detected for zebras and kudus. We discuss possible
  directions for future research to enhance our understanding of waterhole use by
  herbivores.
