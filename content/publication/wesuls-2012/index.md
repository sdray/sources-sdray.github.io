abstract: 'Questions: Which plant traits consistently respond to grazing in different
  years and across habitat-related environmental heterogeneity? Does the proposed
  partial RLQ approach allow partitioning of grazing-related environmental parameters
  from other environmental and temporal variations? Location :Semi-arid savannas of
  central Namibia. Methods: We recorded nine quantitative and 12 categorical traits
  from 87 plant species along grazing gradients in semi-arid Namibian rangelands.
  We sampled from gradients in different habitat settings in 2 yr with differing total
  rainfall amounts. We first examined trait-environment relations with RLQ analysis.
  To remove confounding effects of temporal and habitat-related environmental variation
  on trait performance, we introduced a novel partial RLQ analysis approach. Furthermore,
  we used the fourth-corner statistic to quantify and test relations between traits,
  environmental factors and RLQ axes. Results: Habitats and years had strong influences
  on trait patterns. After removing environmental variation caused by habitats and
  years, grazing became the most influential factor on trait responses. Traits negatively
  correlated with increasing grazing pressure were common to perennial grasses, such
  as long and entire leaves, anemochorous dispersal and rhizomatous growth. Positively
  correlated traits were those common to herbaceous, annual plants with a prostrate-creeping
  habit, compound leaves, high specific leaf area (SLA) and exo- or endozoochorous
  dispersal. Some previously acknowledged grazing response traits, like growth form
  and plant height, were strongly influenced by variations in habitats and years and
  showed no significant correlation with grazing pressure. Conclusion: We emphasize
  that some traits that respond to grazing may also vary under different habitat conditions
  and among years, especially in highly variable environments like semi-arid savannas.
  When analysing trait-environment relations we recommend using approaches that partition
  environmental variation, particularly when applying broad sampling schemes at larger
  geographical scales.'
