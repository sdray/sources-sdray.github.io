abstract: Spatial ecological networks are widely used to model interactions between
  georeferenced biological entities (e.g. populations or communities). The analysis
  of such data often leads to a two-step approach where groups containing similar
  biological entities are firstly identified and the spatial information is used afterwards
  to improve the ecological interpretation. We develop an integrative approach to
  retrieve groups of nodes that are geographically close and ecologically similar.
  Our model-based spatially constrained method embeds the geographical information
  within a regularization framework by adding some constraints to the maximum likelihood
  estimation of parameters. A simulation study and the analysis of two real data sets
  demonstrate that our approach is able to detect complex spatial patterns that are
  ecologically meaningful. The model-based framework allows us to consider external
  information (e.g. geographical proximities, covariates) in the analysis of ecological
  networks and appears to be an appealing alternative to consider such data.
