abstract: 'The purpose of this paper is to describe the development strategy of statistical
  methods to be applied in the field. As an example, the development of multiblock
  regression methods applied to veterinary epidemiological data is described. The
  sequential steps in this strategy are detailed: listing of constraints to be considered,
  methodological development, associated indexes and design of graphical displays,
  testing phase with applications to numerous datasets and finally package development
  on the free R software to make these methods available to all potential users. An
  illustration of a multiblock regression method and of way how to apply it to epidemiological
  data in broiler chickens using the R package is presented in order to identify risk
  factors of losses (mortality and condemnation).'
