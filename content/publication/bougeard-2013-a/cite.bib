 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the development strategy of statistical methods to be applied in the field. As an example, the development of multiblock regression methods applied to veterinary epidemiological data is described. The sequential steps in this strategy are detailed: listing of constraints to be considered, methodological development, associated indexes and design of graphical displays, testing phase with applications to numerous datasets and finally package development on the free R software to make these methods available to all potential users. An illustration of a multiblock regression method and of way how to apply it to epidemiological data in broiler chickens using the R package is presented in order to identify risk factors of losses (mortality and condemnation).},
