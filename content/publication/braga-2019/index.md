abstract: Aim Although much has been said on the spatial distribution of taxonomic
  and phylogenetic diversity of vertebrates, how this diversity interacts in food
  webs and how these interactions change across space are largely unknown. Here, we
  analysed the spatial distribution of tetrapod food webs and asked whether the variation
  in local food web structure is driven by random processes or by natural and anthropogenic
  factors. Location Europe. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Tetrapods. Methods
  We combined an expert-based food web (1,140 species and 70,601 links) of all European
  tetrapods with their respective spatial distributions. We mapped 17 different food
  web metrics representing complexity, chain length, vertical diversity and diet strategy
  across Europe and tested whether their distribution reflects the spatial structure
  of species richness using a null model of food web structure. To avoid multicollinearity
  issues, we defined composite descriptors of food web structure that we related to
  a set of environmental layers summarizing both natural and anthropogenic influences
  and tested their relative importance in explaining the spatial distribution of European
  terrestrial vertebrate food webs. Results Of the 17 metrics, 10 showed a non-random
  spatial distribution across Europe and could be summarized along two major axes
  of variation in food web structure. The first was related to species richness, mean
  trophic level and the proportion of intermediate species, whereas the second was
  related to the connectance and proximity of species within the web. Both descriptors
  varied with latitudinal gradient. The best descriptors of food web structure were
  mean annual temperature and seasonality (negatively correlated with the first axis),
  and human footprint (positively correlated with the second axis). Main conclusions
  We demonstrate the importance of climate and anthropogenic pressure in shaping the
  spatial structure of European tetrapod food webs.
