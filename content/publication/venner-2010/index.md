abstract: Male choosiness for mates is an underexplored mechanism of sexual selection.
  A few theoretical studies suggest that males may exhibit -but only under rare circumstances-
  a reversed male mate choice (RMMC; i.e., highly competitive males focus on the most
  fecund females, while the low‐quality males exclusively pair with less fecund mates
  to avoid being outcompeted by stronger rivals). Here we propose a new model to explore
  RMMC by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions of the previous models and
  by considering an extended range of factors known to alter the strength of sexual
  selection (males’ investment in reproduction, difference of quality between females,
  operational sex ratio). Unexpectedly, we found that males exhibited a reversed mate
  choice under a wide range of circumstances. RMMC mostly occurs when the female encounter
  rate is high and males devote much of their time to breeding. This condition‐dependent
  strategy occurs even if there is no risk of injury during the male‐male contest
  or when the difference in quality between females is small. RMMC should thus be
  a widespread yet underestimated component of sexual selection and should largely
  contribute to the assortative pairing patterns observed in numerous taxa.
