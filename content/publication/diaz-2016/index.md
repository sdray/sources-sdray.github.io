abstract: Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories,
  yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable
  in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major
  traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of
  vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional
  trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-
  quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of
  plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size
  of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum,
  which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant
  trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for
  functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict
  future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.
