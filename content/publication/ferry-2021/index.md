abstract: Questions Species defined as ecosystem engineers (e.g. elephant) are able
  to strongly shape their habitat. In African savannas, elephants have often been
  shown to reduce woody-plant abundance and diversity. However, recent studies highlight
  more complex elephant-induced effects on vegetation. Here, we assessed if long-term
  high elephant densities ($>$2 km(-2)) in a large open landscape resulted in the
  depletion of savanna woodland woody communities or if it led to a new alternative
  equilibrium. Location Woodland savanna of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Elephant
  densities at the study site have remained high for the past two decades ($>$2 km(-)(2)).
  Methods We measured long-term ($>$15 years) elephant utilisation of woody-plant
  communities and their effects on vegetation structure, species composition and functional
  traits (e.g. N leaf concentration, specific leaf area) in 12 vegetation plots. Results
  We observed opportunistic foraging behaviour by elephants with only a slight temporal
  shift in species composition, mainly explained by changes in rare species. Further,
  we did not observe any modification in mean functional trait values, overall height,
  and stem diameters of the woody-plant communities. However, we found differential
  changes in woody-plant abundance according to the height layer (decrease in the
  number of tall plants [$>$200 cm] and increase in the number of short plants [$<$50
  cm]) and a strong reduction in crown diameter for plants in the 50-200 cm height
  class. Conclusion Our study strongly suggests that long-term high elephant densities
  have led to a stable state in savanna woodland vegetation in terms of plant community
  composition and their functional traits. However, high elephant densities did affect
  vegetation structure, which would have several important indirect effects on this
  ecosystem (e.g. predator-prey interactions). We hope that this study stimulates
  more work on the long-term effects of ecosystem engineers in large and open ecosystems.
