abstract: 'Questions: Species defined as ecosystem engineers (e.g. elephant) are able
  to strongly shape their habitat. In African savannas, elephants have often been
  shown to reduce woody-­plant abundance and diversity. However, recent studies highlight
  more complex elephant-­induced effects on vegetation. Here, we assessed if long-­term
  high elephant densities ($>$2 km−2) in a large open landscape resulted in the depletion
  of savanna woodland woody communities or if it led to a new alternative equilibrium.'
