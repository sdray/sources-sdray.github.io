 abstract = {Questions: Species defined as ecosystem engineers (e.g. elephant) are able to strongly shape their habitat. In African savannas, elephants have often been shown to reduce woody-­plant abundance and diversity. However, recent studies highlight more complex elephant-­induced effects on vegetation. Here, we assessed if long-­term high elephant densities ($>$2 km−2) in a large open landscape resulted in the depletion of savanna woodland woody communities or if it led to a new alternative equilibrium.},
