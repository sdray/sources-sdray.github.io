abstract: 'Comparing the architecture of interaction networks in space or time is
  essential for understanding the assembly, trajectory, functioning and persistence
  of species communities. Graph embedding methods, which position networks into a
  vector space where nearby networks have similar architectures, could be ideal tools
  for this purposes. Here, we evaluated the ability of seven graph embedding methods
  to disentangle architectural similarities of interactions networks for supervised
  and unsupervised posterior analytic tasks. The evaluation was carried out over a
  large number of simulated trophic networks representing variations around six ecological
  properties and size. We did not find an overall best method and instead showed that
  the performance of the methods depended on the targeted ecological properties and
  thus on the research questions. We also highlighted the importance of normalising
  the embedding for network sizes for meaningful posterior unsupervised analyses.
  We concluded by orientating potential users to the most suited methods given the
  question, the targeted network ecological property, and outlined links between those
  ecological properties and three ecological processes: robustness to extinction,
  community persistence and ecosystem functioning. We hope this study will stimulate
  the appropriation of graph embedding methods by ecologists.'
