abstract: Correspondence analysis with linear external constraints on both the rows
  and the columns has been mentioned in the ecological literature, but lacks full
  mathematical treatment and easily available algorithms and software. This paper
  fills this gap by defining the method as maximizing the fourth-corner correlation
  between linear combinations, by providing novel algorithms, which demonstrate relationships
  with related methods, and by making a detailed study of possible biplots and associated
  approximations. The method is illustrated using ecological data on the abundances
  of species in sites and where the species are characterized by traits and sites
  by environmental variables. The trait data and environment data form the external
  constraints and the question is which traits and environmental variables are associated,
  how these associations drive species abundances and how they can be displayed in
  biplots. With microbiome data becoming widely available, these and related multivariate
  methods deserve more study as they might be routinely used in the future.
