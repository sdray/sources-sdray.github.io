abstract: Establishing trait-environment relationships has become routine in community
  ecology. Here, we demonstrate that the Community Weighted Means correlation (CWM)
  and its parallel approach in linking trait variation to the environment, the Species
  Niche Centroid correlation (SNC), have important shortcomings, arguing against their
  continuing application. Using mathematical derivations and simulations, we show
  that the two major issues are inconsistent parameter estimation and unacceptable
  significance rates when only the environment or only traits are structuring species
  distributions, but they themselves are not linked. We show how both CWM and SNC
  are related to the fourth-corner correlation and propose to replace all by the Chessel
  fourth-corner correlation, which is the fourth-corner correlation divided by its
  maximum attainable value. We propose an appropriate hypothesis testing procedure
  that is not only unbiased but also has much greater statistical power in detecting
  trait-environmental relationships. We derive an additive framework in which trait
  variation is partitioned among and within communities, which can be then modeled
  against the environment. We finish by presenting a contrast between methods and
  an application of our proposed framework across 85 lake-fish metacommunities.This
