abstract: Aim Ecological limits on population sizes and the number of species a region
  can sustain are thought to simultaneously produce spatial patterns in population
  genetic diversity and species richness due to the effects of random drift operating
  in parallel across population and community levels. Here, we test the extent to
  which resource-based environmental limits jointly determine these patterns of biodiversity
  in amphibians. Location North America. Taxon Amphibians. Methods We repurposed open,
  raw microsatellite data from 19 species sampled at 554 sites in North America and
  mapped nuclear genetic diversity at the continental scale. We then tested whether
  ecological limits defined by resource availability and environmental heterogeneity
  could simultaneously shape biogeographic patterns in genetic diversity and species
  richness with structural equation modelling. Results Spatial patterns of population
  genetic diversity run opposite patterns of species richness and genetic differentiation.
  However, while measures of resource availability and niche heterogeneity predict
  89% of the variation in species richness, these landscape metrics were poor predictors
  of genetic diversity. Main conclusions Although heterogeneity appears to be an important
  driver of genetic and species biodiversity patterns in amphibians, variation in
  genetic diversity both within and across species makes it difficult to infer general
  processes producing spatial patterns of amphibian genetic diversity. This result
  differs from those found in endotherms and may be due to the considerable life history
  variation found across amphibians.
