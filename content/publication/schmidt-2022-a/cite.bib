 abstract = {Aim: Ecological limits on population sizes and the number of species a region can sustain are thought to simultaneously produce spatial patterns in population genetic diversity and species richness due to the effects of random drift operating in parallel across population and community levels. Here, we test the extent to which resource-­based environmental limits jointly determine these patterns of biodiversity in amphibians.},
