abstract: "Spatial autocorrelation jeopardizes the validity of statistical inference,\
  \ for example correlation and regression analysis. Restricted randomization methods\
  \ can account for the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the observed data by\
  \ building it into an empirical null model for hypothesis testing. This can be achieved,\
  \ for example, based on conditional simulation, which fits a highly parameterized\
  \ geostatistical model to the observed spatial structure, or, for data observed\
  \ on a regular transect or grid, with Fourier spectral randomization methods that\
  \ can flexibly model spatial structure at any scale. This study uses Moran eigenvector\
  \ maps to extend spectral randomization to irregularly spaced samples. We present\
  \ different algorithms to perform restricted randomization to suit different types\
  \ of research questions: individual randomization of each variable, joint randomization\
  \ of a group of variables while keeping within-group correlations fixed, and randomization\
  \ with a fixed correlation between original data and randomized replicates (e.g.\
  \ as input for simulation studies). The performance of the proposed Moran spectral\
  \ randomization methods for regularly and irregularly spaced samples is assessed\
  \ with correlation analysis of simulated data. Moran spectral randomization closely\
  \ matched the spatial structure of original simulated data sets, with identical\
  \ or nearly identical Moran's I values and power spectra, depending on the algorithm.\
  \ In correlation analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables, Moran spectral\
  \ randomization produced correct type I error rates for stationary spatial data,\
  \ even for very small and highly irregular samples, but was sensitive to linear\
  \ trend. When one or both variables lacked spatial structure, Moran spectral randomization\
  \ tests were more conservative than correlation t-tests. The proposed Moran spectral\
  \ randomization method requires a minimum of parameterization and is able to address\
  \ multivariate data with spatial structure at multiple scales, with the option of\
  \ controlling levels of correlation with the original data. It can provide technically\
  \ unlimited numbers of randomizations even for small samples while closely maintaining\
  \ the spatial characteristics of uni- or multivariate data at all spatial scales.\
  \ The method is applicable for correlation analysis of stationary, autocorrelated\
  \ spatial or temporal series. Further research should assess whether the method\
  \ can be extended to multiple regression analysis."
