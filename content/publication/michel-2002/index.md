abstract: Modelling of the spatial distribution of bovine trypanosomosis prevalence
  in Sideradougou district Burkina Faso was performed by using a combination of spatial
  and statistical analysis. Based on a comprehensive and geographically representative
  census of herds and farms in the area, more than 2000 cattle were randomly chosen
  and their blood sampled during field survey. Data on livestock farming practices
  were recorded for each farm. All data were mapped within a GIS to generate new information
  on spatial constraints in the area. Surveys results were analysed and serological
  prevalence data were modelled using logistic regression. The model allowed identification
  and quantification of risk factors. In a second step the statistical model was used
  predictively on the entire farm population in the area. This method was successful
  in predicting the serological prevalence for each individual herd in the sample,
  from their livestock management patterns and spatial location. Predicted prevalences
  were represented within the GIS, taking daily movements of animals into account.
  Spatial distribution of prevalence would illustrate specific locations at risk from
  an epidemiological viewpoint. It gives evidence that the hydrological network and
  land occupation patterns in the savanna-type countryside are playing an important
  part when structuring a so-called \"trypanosomosis space\".
