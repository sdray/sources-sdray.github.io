abstract: "The computation of Moran's index of spatial autocorrelation requires the\
  \ definition of a spatial weighting matrix. The eigendecomposition of this doubly\
  \ centered matrix (i.e., one that forces the sums of all rows and columns to equal\
  \ zero) has interesting properties that have been exploited in various contexts:\
  \ distribution properties of the Moran coefficient (MC), spatial filtering in linear\
  \ models, generalized linear models, and multivariate analysis. In this article,\
  \ this eigendecomposition is used to propose a new view of MC based on its interpretation\
  \ in the simple context of linear regression. I use this interpretation to demonstrate\
  \ the different properties of MC and also the inefficiency of this index in some\
  \ situations involving simultaneous positive and negative spatial autocorrelation.\
  \ I propose some new statistics and procedures for testing spatial autocorrelation,\
  \ and conduct a simulation study to evaluate these new approaches."
