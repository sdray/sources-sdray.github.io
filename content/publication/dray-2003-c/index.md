abstract: Ecological studies often require studying the common structure of a pair
  of data tables. Co-inertia analysis is a multivariate method for coupling two tables.
  It is often neglected by ecologists who prefer the widely used methods of redundancy
  analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. We present the co-inertia criterion
  for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on
  this criterion as are canonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation
  analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is
  very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is
  suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy environmental variables. Moreover,
  various weighting of sites and various transformations and/or centering of species
  data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological considerations can be
  taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this
  method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices
  or to the case of more than two tables. Simulated ecological data are used to compare
  the co-inertia approach with other available methods.
