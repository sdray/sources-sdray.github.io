abstract: Procrustes analysis is a method for fitting a set of points to another.
  These two sets of points are often defined by the measurements of two sets of variables
  for the same individuals (e.g., measurements of species abundances and environmental
  variables at the same sites). We present a solution for graphical representation
  of the results of procrustes analysis when the number of variables in each of the
  two datasets exceeds two. This method is named procrustean co-inertia analysis because
  it is based on the joint use of procrustes analysis and co-inertia analysis, which
  is a coupling method for finding linear combinations of two sets of variables of
  maximal covariance. It provides better graphical representation of the concordance
  between the two datasets than classical co-inertia analysis. Moreover, distance
  matrices can be introduced in the analysis to improve its ecological meaning. Lastly,
  a randomization test equivalent to PROTEST is proposed as an alternative to the
  Mantel test. An ecological example is presented to illustrate the method.
