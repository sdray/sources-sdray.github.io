abstract: 'Standard multivariate analysis methods aim to identify and summarize the
  main structures in large data sets containing the description of a number of observations
  by several variables. In many cases, spatial information is also available for each
  observation, so that a map can be associated to the multivariate data set. Two main
  objectives are relevant in the analysis of spatial multivariate data: summarizing
  covariation structures and identifying spatial patterns. In practice, achieving
  both goals simultaneously is a statistical challenge, and a range of methods have
  been developed that offer trade-offs between these two objectives. In an applied
  context, this methodological question has been and remains a major issue in community
  ecology, where species assemblages (i.e., covariation between species abundances)
  are often driven by spatial processes (and thus exhibit spatial patterns). In this
  paper we review a variety of methods developed in community ecology to investigate
  multivariate spatial patterns. We present different ways of incorporating spatial
  constraints in multivariate analysis and illustrate these different approaches using
  the famous data set on moral statistics in France published by André-Michel Guerry
  in 1833. We discuss and compare the properties of these different approaches both
  from a practical and theoretical viewpoint.'
