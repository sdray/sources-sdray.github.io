abstract: The methods of direct gradient analysis and variation partitioning are the
  most widely used frameworks to evaluate the contributions of species sorting to
  metacommunity structure. In many cases, however, species are also driven by spatial
  processes that are independent of environmental heterogeneity (e.g., neutral dynamics).
  As such, spatial autocorrelation can occur independently in both species (due to
  limited dispersal) and the environmental data, leading to spurious correlations
  between species distributions and the spatialized (i.e., spatially-autocorrelated)
  environment. In these cases, the method of variation partitioning may present high
  Type I error rates (i.e., reject the null hypothesis more often than the pre-established
  critical level) and inflated estimates regarding the environmental component that
  is used to estimate the importance of species sorting. In this paper, we (1) demonstrate
  that metacommunities driven by neutral dynamics (via limited dispersal) alone or
  in combination with species sorting leads to inflated estimates and Type I error
  rates when testing for the importance of species sorting; and (2) propose a general
  and flexible new variation partitioning procedure to adjust for spurious contributions
  due to spatial autocorrelation from the environmental fraction. We used simulated
  metacommunity data driven by pure neutral, pure species sorting, and mixed (i.e.
  neutral + species sorting dynamics) processes to evaluate the performances of our
  new methodological framework. We also demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework
  with an empirical plant dataset in which we show that half of the variation initially
  due to the environment by the standard variation partitioning framework was due
  to spurious correlations.
