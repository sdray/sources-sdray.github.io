abstract: Microbial communities, which drive major ecosystem functions, consist of
  a wide range of interacting species. Understanding how microbial communities are
  structured and the processes underlying this is crucial to interpreting ecosystem
  responses to global change but is challenging as microbial interactions cannot usually
  be directly observed. Multiple efforts are currently focused to combine next-generation
  sequencing (NGS) techniques with refined statistical analysis (e.g., network analysis,
  multivariate analysis) to characterize the structures of microbial communities.
  However, most of these approaches consider a single table of sequencing data measured
  for several samples. Technological advances now make it possible to collect NGS
  data on different taxonomic groups simultaneously for the same samples, allowing
  us to analyse a pair of tables. Here, an analytical framework based on co-correspondence
  analysis (CoCA) is proposed to study the distributions, assemblages and interactions
  between two microbial communities. We show the ability of this approach to highlight
  the relationships between two microbial communities, using two data sets exhibiting
  various types of interactions. CoCA identified strong association patterns between
  autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial eukaryote assemblages, on the one hand,
  and between microalgae and viruses, on the other. We demonstrate also how CoCA can
  be used, complementary to network analysis, to reorder co-occurrence networks and
  thus investigate the presence of patterns in ecological networks.
