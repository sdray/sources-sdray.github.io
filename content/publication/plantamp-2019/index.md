abstract: Phenotypic plasticity may contribute to the invasive success of an alien
  species in a new environment. A highly plastic species may survive and reproduce
  in more diverse environments, thereby supporting establishment and colonization.
  We focused on plasticity in the circadian rhythm of activity, which can favour species
  coexistence in invasion, for the invasive species Drosophila suzukii, which is expected
  to be a weaker direct competitor than other Drosophila species of the resident community.
  We compared the circadian rhythms of the locomotor activity in adults and the expression
  of clock genes in response to temperature in the invasive D. suzukii and the resident
  Drosophila melanogaster. We showed that D. suzukii is active in a narrower range
  of temperatures than D. melanogaster and that the activities of the two species
  overlap during the day, regardless of the temperature. Both species are diurnal
  and exhibit rhythmic activity at dawn and dusk, with a much lower activity at dawn
  for D. suzukii females. Our results show that the timeless and clock genes are good
  candidates to explain the plastic response that is observed in relation to temperature.
  Overall, our results suggest that thermal phenotypic plasticity in D. suzukii activity
  is not sufficient to explain the invasive success of D. suzukii and call for testing
  other hypotheses, such as the release of competitors and/or predators.
