abstract: Both the ordination of taxonomic tables and the measurements of species
  diversity aim to capture the prominent features of the species composition of a
  community. However, interrelations between ordination techniques and diversity measurements
  are seldom explicated and are mainly ignored by many field ecologists. This paper
  starts from the notion of the species occurrence table, which provides a unifying
  formulation for different kinds of taxonomic data. Here it is demonstrated that
  alternative species weightings can be used to equate the total inertia of a centered-by-species
  occurrence table with common diversity indices, such as species richness, Simpson
  diversity, or Shannon information. Such an equation defines two main ordination
  strategies related to two different but consistent measures of species diversity.
  The first places emphasis on scarce species and is based on Correspondence Analysis
  and species richness (CA-richness strategy). The second, in which abundant species
  are prominent, relies on Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis and Simpson diversity
  (NSCA-Simpson strategy). Both strategies are suitable for measuring ? and ? diversity
  by analyzing the centered-by-species occurrence table with respect to external environmental
  or instrumental variables. In this paper, these two strategies are applied to ecological
  data obtained in a Neotropical rainforest plot. The results are then discussed with
  respect to the intrinsic characteristics of the community under analysis, and also
  to the broad classes of floro-faunistic data used in ecology (i.e., data gathered
  from museum or herbarium collections, exhaustive inventories in a reference plot,
  or enumeration through species-by-relevés tables). The approach encompasses several
  well-known techniques such as Correspondence Analysis, Non-Symmetric Correspondence
  Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, and Redundancy Analysis, and provides
  greater insight into interrelations between ordination methods and diversity studies.
