abstract: Methods for coupling two data sets (species composition and environmental
  variables for example) are well known and often used in ecology. All these methods
  require that variables of the two data sets have been recorded at the same sample
  stations. But if the two data sets arise from different sample schemes, sample locations
  can be different. In this case, scientists usually transform one data set to conform
  with the other one that is chosen as a reference. This inevitably leads to some
  loss of information. We propose a new ordination method, named spatial-RLQ analysis,
  for coupling two data sets with different spatial sample techniques. Spatial-RLQ
  analysis is an extension of co-inertia analysis and is based on neighbourhood graph
  theory and classical RLQ analysis. This analysis finds linear combinations of variables
  of the two data sets which maximize the spatial cross-covariance. This provides
  a co-ordination of the two data sets according to their spatial relationships. A
  vegetation study concerning the forest of Chizé (western France) is presented to
  illustrate the method.
