abstract: Predators generate a \"landscape of fear\" within which prey can minimize
  the risk of predation by selecting low-risk areas. Depending on the spatial structure
  of this \"landscape\", i.e., whether it is coarse- or fine-grained, prey may respond
  to increased risk by shifting their home ranges or by fine-scale redistributions
  within these ranges, respectively. We studied how wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758)
  responded to temporal changes in risk in hunted areas (risky habitat) surrounding
  a nature reserve (refuge habitat). Animals with home ranges \"in contact\" with
  the reserve during the low-risk season were the only ones to shift toward the refuge
  when the risk increased. These shifts occurred at two temporal scales in response
  to the increased risk during the daytime and during the hunting season. Whereas
  animals not influenced by the reserve found food and shelter in forest during the
  hunting season, shifts to the refuge area were detrimental to the rather scarce
  forest areas in the reserve. This confirms that spatiotemporal changes in risk are
  major drivers of animal distribution when predation strongly limits their fitness.
  Their response is, however, scale-dependent and reflects at the individual level
  the perceived structure of their \"landscape of fear\".
